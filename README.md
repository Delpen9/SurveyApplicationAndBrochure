# SurveyApplicationAndBrochure
An attempt at making a new resume application for the IEEE SPAC event until the idea was scrapped. 
This application is meant to be run on a phone rather than on a computer. 
To view it in its intended form, look at it from Chrome/Firefox developer tools.

Disclaimer: Remove animations to prevent console errors.

Contained in this Git Repository is the ./src file of my Survey website using the Angular 6 application.

1. To run the repository, have Angular 6+ installed on your computer.
2. Create a generic project: 
   $ ng new projectName <br />
3. Replace the default ./src file with the one contained in this repository.
4. All dependencies are linked in the index.html file.
